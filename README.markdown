###Swiz is a brutally simple micro-architecture for creating Rich Internet Applications with ActionScript 3 and Adobe Flex

For information about swiz; please visit the [Swiz wiki](http://wiki.swizframework.org/).

This fork of Swiz is not mavenized, however is up to date with other forks which includes some minor bug fixes. (See history)
I also removed Flex 3 support and a made few changes here and there.

To compile Swiz, copy build/build.properties.template and rename to build.properties.
In the file; set the sdk path and call "ant -f ./build/build.xml compile" or use your favourite ant builder.

Please do not hesitate to send pull requests if you find a bug or code a feature.
